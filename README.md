# FMator

FMator is an FM synthesizer software synthesizer currently released as a Windows standalone application and as a VST3 plugin. It was developed for my University final year dissertation and was written in C++ using the JUCE Framework.

## Installation

There is currently no release package so JUCE along with the Projucer is required.

Clone the repository and open the projucer file with Projucer. Build in your desired IDE.

Note this has only been tested on my computer using Visual Studio 2019 and JUCE 6.0.7
